# Question: How do you maximize the number of coins by bursting balloons in a specific order? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `maxCoins` is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the number of coins obtained by bursting balloons in a specific order. The function uses dynamic programming to achieve this. It first creates an array `input` that contains the values of the balloons, with an additional 1 added at both ends. It then initializes a two-dimensional array `dp` to store the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by bursting balloons from index `i` to `j` in the `input` array. The function then iterates over all possible lengths of subarrays and all possible starting points of these subarrays. For each subarray, it tries bursting all balloons and updates the `dp[i][j]` value with the maximum coins that can be obtained. The function finally returns the value of `dp[1][n]`, which represents the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by bursting all balloons.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is very similar to the JavaScript version. The logic and the algorithm used to solve the problem are the same in both versions. The main difference is that TypeScript includes type annotations, which provide additional information about the types of variables and function return values. This can help catch potential errors at compile time, and can also make the code easier to understand and maintain.

In the TypeScript version, the function `maxCoins` is annotated with a return type of `number`, and the parameter `nums` is annotated with a type of `number[]`, indicating that it is an array of numbers. This makes it clear that the function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a number.

Another difference is in the way the 2D array `dp` is initialized. In the JavaScript version, a for loop is used to fill each element of the array with a new array filled with zeros. In the TypeScript version, the `Array.from` method is used to create the 2D array. This is a more concise way to create the array, but it works in the same way and produces the same result.

Overall, the TypeScript version provides the same solution to the problem as the JavaScript version, but with additional type safety and a slightly different syntax for creating the 2D array.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses the same dynamic programming approach as the JavaScript version to solve the problem. Both versions first add 1 to the beginning and end of the input array, then initialize a 2D array to store the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by bursting balloons from index `i` to `j`. They then iterate over all possible lengths of subarrays and all possible starting points of these subarrays, and for each subarray, they try bursting all balloons and update `dp[i][j]` with the maximum coins that can be obtained. Finally, they return `dp[1][n]`, which is the maximum coins that can be obtained by bursting all balloons.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in the languages themselves:

1. In C++, we use `vector` instead of JavaScript's `Array` to store the balloon values and the dynamic programming table. The `vector` class is a template class of C++ Standard Library that implements dynamic arrays.

2. In C++, we use the `insert` function to add 1 to the beginning and end of the `nums` vector. In JavaScript, we use a for loop to copy the values from `nums` to `input` and add 1 at both ends.

3. In C++, we use the `max` function from the `algorithm` library to find the maximum value. In JavaScript, we use the `Math.max` function.

4. The C++ version is wrapped in a `main` function and uses `cout` for output, while the JavaScript version uses `console.log` for output.
